## Description

YouZoo was designed with relaxing in mind. The goal is for the user to have a pleasant, cerebral experience at a virtual zoo, with the ability to write posts.

### MVP

Users should be able to get a random animal with a button click, and be able to post/leave comments on the website. Users can read, post, edit, and delete comments. The website should be pleasing to look at.

### POST-MVP

In the future, users should be able to leave comments on the specific animals. Also, users should be able to authenticate themselves so that when an individual posts a comment, only they can edit or delete it.
